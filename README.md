Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Algorithms
An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

Big O Notation
Big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

Big O Notation	Computations for 10 elements	Computations for 100 elements	Computations for 1000 elements
O(1)	1	1	1
O(log N)	3	6	9
O(N)	10	100	1000
O(N log N)	30	600	9000
O(N^2)	100	10000	1000000
O(2^N)	1024	1.26e+29	1.07e+301
O(N!)	3628800	9.3e+157	4.02e+2567
